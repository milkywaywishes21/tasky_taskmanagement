# tasky_taskmanagement

Welcome to Tasky: Daily Task Management System!

This is a simple, yet colorful, task management project that allows users to create and modify (meaning add, delete, or complete tasks) a task list of up to 20 tasks, while encouraging mental wellness upon each completion! By completing tasks from your task list, you will add to your completed tasks counter, as well as receive a friendly message and/or reminder from our system that motivates you to keep doing your best to complete your task list while making sure to take care of yourself! You will also be able to save and load any changes upon returning to the title screen!

To run this program, it is suggested that you download Python to your computer, if you do not have it installed already. From there, you can open the Tasky_TaskManagement.py file in the Python IDLE shell after extracting the ZIP file's contents and run the code!

#NOTE 1: This project uses Pillow, an external library that allows for the importing and modifications of images. Please ensure that you have it installed before running this program, or otherwise the code will not run! After installing Python, you can install Pillow by searching for and opening the Command Prompt application on Windows (or Terminal application for Mac users), and entering in "pip install pillow" as your input. Clicking Enter will then install the package on your computer and allow you to open it on Python!
