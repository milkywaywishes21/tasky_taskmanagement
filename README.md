# tasky_taskmanagement

Welcome to Tasky: Daily Task Management System!

This is a simple and colorful task management project that allows you to create and modify a task list, while encouraging mental wellness and a positive mindset! Here, you will be able to add up to 20 tasks of up to 100 characters and delete tasks to your liking! 

With each task that you complete, you will add to your completed tasks counter, as well as receive a friendly message and/or reminder from our system. We hope this will motivate you to get all of your tasks done, but also serve as a good reminder to take care of yourself after all your hard work! :)

Upon returning to the title screen, you will be able to save any changes you make to your task list. Make sure to do that every time you run the program to save all your inputs and your completed tasks counter! This progress can then be loaded up the next time you use the task management system!

#HOW TO RUN:
1. Download the Github ZIP file.
2. Open the Github File and extract all contents.
3. Install Python to your computer (if you have not already.)
4. Install Pillow to Python (more instructions found in NOTE 1 below!)
5. Open the Python IDLE Shell and open the Tasky_TaskManagement.py file (if needed, search through the extracted Tasky_Task Management file).
6. You are now ready to get started! Enjoy!

##NOTE 1: This project uses Pillow, an external library that allows for the importing and modifications of images. Please ensure that you have it installed before running this program, or otherwise the code will not run! After installing Python, you can install Pillow by searching for and opening the Command Prompt application on Windows (or Terminal application for Mac users), and entering in "pip install pillow" as your input. Clicking Enter will then install the package on your computer and allow you to open it in Python!

###NOTE 2: While the code is programmed to exit the program after you click Exit and view the popup windows, this does not happen to function the same way for when it is used in Python IDLE, but did function as it was meant to in Pycharm (the IDE in which this program was written). We apologize in advance for this inconvenience. 

Please use the Windows key to view and close the window (or force quit on Mac) if this causes a problem.
